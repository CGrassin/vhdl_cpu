# VHDL CPU

This repository contains all resources for my VHDL implementation of a simple CPU architecture. The purpose is learning/education, please read the article about this design, how it works and how it is implemented: TODO

In this repo is:
* The `CGASM` assembler for the custom instruction set,
* The VHDL project (Xilinx ISE Webpack format).
